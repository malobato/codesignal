## reverseInParentheses
<p>
Write a function that reverses characters in (possibly nested) parentheses in the input string.
Input strings will always be well-formed with matching ()s.
</p>

## isIPv4Address
<p>
An IP address is a numerical label assigned to each device (e.g., computer, printer) participating in a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. There are two versions of the Internet protocol, and thus two versions of addresses. One of them is the IPv4 address.
Given a string, find out if it satisfies the IPv4 address naming rules.
</p>

## avoidObstacles
<p>
You are given an array of integers representing coordinates of obstacles situated on a straight line.
Assume that you are jumping from the point with coordinate 0 to the right. You are allowed only to make jumps of the same length represented by some integer.
Find the minimal length of the jump enough to avoid all the obstacles.
</p>

## Box Blur
<p>
Last night you partied a little too hard. Now there's a black and white photo of you that's about to go viral! You can't let this ruin your reputation, so you want to apply the box blur algorithm to the photo to hide its content.
The pixels in the input image are represented as integers. The algorithm distorts the input image in the following way: Every pixel x in the output image has a value equal to the average value of the pixel values from the 3 × 3 square that has its center at x, including x itself. All the pixels on the border of x are then removed.
Return the blurred image as an integer, with the fractions rounded down.

## Growing Plant
<p>
Caring for a plant can be hard work, but since you tend to it regularly, you have a plant that grows consistently. Each day, its height increases by a fixed amount represented by the integer upSpeed. But due to lack of sunlight, the plant decreases in height every night, by an amount represented by downSpeed.

Since you grew the plant from a seed, it started at height 0 initially. Given an integer desiredHeight, your task is to find how many days it'll take for the plant to reach this height.
</p>

##  Knapsack Light
<p>
You found two items in a treasure chest! The first item weighs weight1 and is worth value1, and the second item weighs weight2 and is worth value2. What is the total maximum value of the items you can take with you, assuming that your max weight capacity is maxW and you can't come back for the items later?
Note that there are only two items and you can't bring more than one item of each type, i.e. you can't take two first items or two second items.

</p>

## Is Beautiful String
<p>
A string is said to be beautiful if each letter in the string appears at most as many times as the previous letter in the alphabet within the string; ie: b occurs no more times than a; c occurs no more times than b; etc. Note that letter a has no previous letter.
Given a string, check whether it is beautiful.
</p>

## Find Email Domain
<p>
An email address such as "John.Smith@example.com" is made up of a local part ("John.Smith"), an "@" symbol, then a domain part ("example.com").
The domain name part of an email address may only consist of letters, digits, hyphens and dots. The local part, however, also allows a lot of different special characters. Here you can look at several examples of correct and incorrect email addresses.
Given a valid email address, find its domain part.
</p>

## Build Palindrome
<p>
Given a string, find the shortest possible string which can be achieved by adding characters to the end of initial string to make it a palindrome.
</p>

## Elections Winner
<p>
Elections are in progress!
Given an array of the numbers of votes given to each of the candidates so far, and an integer k equal to the number of voters who haven't cast their vote yet, find the number of candidates who still have a chance to win the election.
The winner of the election must secure strictly more votes than any other candidate. If two or more candidates receive the same (maximum) number of votes, assume there is no winner at all.
</p>

## is MAC48 Address
<p>
A media access control address (MAC address) is a unique identifier assigned to network interfaces for communications on the physical network segment.
The standard (IEEE 802) format for printing MAC-48 addresses in human-friendly form is six groups of two hexadecimal digits (0 to 9 or A to F), separated by hyphens (e.g. 01-23-45-67-89-AB).
Your task is to check by given string inputString whether it corresponds to MAC-48 address or not.
</p>

## is Digit
<p>
Determine if the given character is a digit or not.
</p>

## line Encoding
<p>
Given a string, return its encoding defined as follows:
First, the string is divided into the least possible number of disjoint substrings consisting of identical characters
for example, "aabbbc" is divided into ["aa", "bbb", "c"]
Next, each substring with length greater than one is replaced with a concatenation of its length and the repeating character
for example, substring "bbb" is replaced by "3b"
Finally, all the new strings are concatenated together in the same order and a new string is returned.
</p>

## chess Knight
<p>
Given a position of a knight on the standard chessboard, find the number of different moves the knight can perform.
The knight can move to a square that is two squares horizontally and one square vertically, or two squares vertically and one square horizontally away from it. The complete move therefore looks like the letter L. Check out the image below to see all valid moves for a knight piece that is placed on one of the central squares.
</p>

## delete Digit

</p>

## Sum up Numbers
<p>
CodeMaster has just returned from shopping. He scanned the check of the items he bought and gave the resulting string to Ratiorg to figure out the total number of purchased items. Since Ratiorg is a bot he is definitely going to automate it, so he needs a program that sums up all the numbers which appear in the given input.
Help Ratiorg by writing a function that returns the sum of numbers that appear in the given inputString.
</p>

## Different Squares
<p>
Given a rectangular matrix containing only digits, calculate the number of different 2 × 2 squares in it.
</p>

## Digits Product
<p>
Given an integer product, find the smallest positive (i.e. greater than 0) integer the product of whose digits is equal to product. If there is no such integer, return -1 instead.
</p>

## File Naming
<p>
You are given an array of strings names representing filenames. The array is sorted in order of file creation, such that names[i] represents the name of a file created before names[i+1] and after names[i-1] (assume 0-based indexing). Because all files must have unique names, files created later with the same name as a file created earlier should have an additional (k) suffix in their names, where k is the smallest positive integer (starting from 1) that does not appear in previous file names.
Your task is to iterate through all elements of names (from left to right) and update all filenames based on the above. Return an array of proper filenames.
</p>

## Message From Binary Code
<p>
You are taking part in an Escape Room challenge designed specifically for programmers. In your efforts to find a clue, you've found a binary code written on the wall behind a vase, and realized that it must be an encrypted message. After some thought, your first guess is that each consecutive 8 bits of the code stand for the character with the corresponding extended ASCII code.
Assuming that your hunch is correct, decode the message.
